# Brief History of Web, Webdesign, UI/UX
<DurationSnippet i="3" />

::: warning 

The history is in a separate chapter here, because the structure of curriculum demands so. 
<br>But a lot of articles and videos in previous chapter ['What is interactive graphics'](./what#user-interface-ui) already cover history as well. There is no point to copy it, so be sure to check out that part too.
