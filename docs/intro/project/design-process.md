# The design process

Once we understand the problem, the project begins. Again - the actual process depends on the client or team or size of the project etc, but here is one possible way.


### 1. Define

- **client research** - today we often don't do things from scratch, but renewing or redefining existing products
- **user research** - who is our main user? what do they want?
- **market research** - what's going on out there?

### 2. Ideate

- collecting inspiration
- mindmaps
- brainstorms
- sketches

### 3. Prototype

- **lo-fi prototypes** - pen and paper or early computer wireframes
- testing
- **defining style:** color, typography, tone of voice etc
- **hi-fi prototypes** - interactive designs, Figma etc
- testing

### 4. Build

- developing, coding
- testing

### 5. Analyze

- measuring
- statistics
- testing
- **improve it!**
