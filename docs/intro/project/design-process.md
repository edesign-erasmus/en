# The design process

The actual design process depends on the team workflow / client / project etc, but usually these steps are involved: 

1. research / background
2. planning / ideas
3. prototyping
4. making / executing  
5. measuring / analyzing

Changing things and correct mistakes is much easier with digital products. It means, that usually teams work in loops - you should test often and early and take a step back in process, if needed. 



### 1. Define

- **client research** - today we often don't do things from scratch, but renewing or redefining existing products
- **user research** - who is our main user? what do they want?
- **market research** - what's going on out there?

### 2. Ideate

- collecting inspiration
- mindmaps
- brainstorms
- sketches

### 3. Prototype

- **lo-fi prototypes** - pen and paper or early computer wireframes
- testing
- **defining style:** color, typography, tone of voice etc
- **hi-fi prototypes** - interactive designs, Figma etc
- testing

### 4. Build

- developing, coding
- testing

### 5. Analyze

- measuring
- statistics
- testing
- **improve it!**
