## ‚úã Before we start

Should we talk a bit about the [Erasmus Edesign project](https://e-disain.eu/en/) here? Or at least mention, that these materials are part of the project. Ok, now I mentioned it. Good.

## Overview

- Right now here is one Module of the whole Interactive Graphics Curriculum.
- From the top menu ‚òù you'll find 4 learning outcomes or big Chapters of the module:
  1. **Introduction** to the subject
  2. Basics of **FrontEnd** developement
  3. UI/UX **design basics**
  4. Creating **web graphics**
- Once inside any of the 4 Chapters, you'll find Topics and Subtopics of each chapter from the üëà left sidebar.




::: tip

The web is evolving in such speed that todays articles may often be obsolete tomorrow. So if you plan to use this material at your own, use it as a reference - but always search for more/newer sources.

From time to time you may find some sidenotes or other thoughts like that. Mostly for teachers etc.

They are usually hidden by default, so they do not affect the overall reading flow. And usually they come before or after the main content.
