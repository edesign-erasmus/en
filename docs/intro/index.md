# Introdcution to Interactive Graphics (IG)
 



## ðŸ‘‰ Before we start

First, let's talk about the term ***Interactive Graphics***. If you google it, most of the results are probably related to data analysis and infographics or maybe some (oldschool) visualization techniques, which may be a bit confusing. 

We use *Interactive Graphics* here, because our content correspond to specific competence standard in Estonian vocational school system, where the curriculum is named [*Interaktiivne graafika*](https://www.kutseregister.ee/ctrl/en/Standardid/vaata/10719487). 

Basically we talk about beginner level WEB- and UI design with a little bit of front-end, markup and coding skills.

Notice the section with a stopwatch above this block ðŸ‘†. From this you see, how many hours every topic takes and what kind of work is planned for this. Here the stopwatch says that we'll do a very brief introductin during 2 hours at school. And that's it. Because you'll learn most of the things and most of the time **at your workplace**.
