# Introduction to Interactive Graphics

## âœ‹ Before we start

First, let's talk about the term ***Interactive Graphics***. If you google it, most of the results are probably related to data analysis and infographics or maybe some (often oldschool) visualization techniques, which may be a bit confusing. 

We use the term *Interactive Graphics* here, because our content correspond to specific competence standard in Estonian vocational school system, where the curriculum is named [*Interaktiivne graafika*](https://www.kutseregister.ee/ctrl/en/Standardid/vaata/10719487). 

Basically we talk about beginner level WEB- and UI design skills with basic understanding of front-end process, markup and coding languages.
