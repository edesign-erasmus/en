# JS Syntax

## Why JavaScript?

Before we jump into JavaScript syntax let's talk briefly about what is JavaScript where it's used and what you can do with it?

JavaScript is scripting language which can be run in web browser.

In previous chapters we talked about HTML and CSS. Mastering these two you can already design and build cool and beautiful web pages. But what if you want to add interactivity to the page?

Think about a web page with a chat feature. After typing your message into text field you push the button and without navigating to next page your message is sent to your friend.

And similarly when your friend answers the message appears on the screen without you desperately pressing the reload button and checking if you have a new message.

The chat even has notification and ding sound! ðŸ””

Everything described above can be achieved with JavaScript.

<div class="important">

If you want to let users interact with a web page like pushing buttons, draging elements, clicking icons you have to add JavaScript.

</div>

## Syntax

Before you start adding interactivity to your page it's good to get a glance what tools you have in your toolbox. Acutally there aren't too many.

**Variables** are used for storing data. If we create a variable we give it a name and value. Good name is descriptive so we can tell what kind of value is stored into variable just by looking at the name.
By name we can later access the value.
Maybe you already assumed by it's name that we can change the value of variable if needed.

**Data types**

The best way to get to know JavaScript is complete one of the many interactive courses online.

I recommend freeCodeCamp [JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/) curriculum and from there please complete **Basic JavaScript** chapter.

Of course I encourage you to dig deeper and also check out other chapters.
