# LO-FI prototypes

## What is a prototype

We have a new term here: *prototype*. What is it exactly? 

> According to Wikipedia:
> <mark>A prototype is an early sample, model, or release of a product built to **test a concept or process**.</mark>

Prototypes are made both for physical and digital products. Testing helps us discover design flaws and misunderstandings. And the earlier we test, the earlier we can find basic errors.
